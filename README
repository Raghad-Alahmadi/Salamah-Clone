Salamah Clone
Overview
Salamah Clone is a project aimed at replicating the functionality of the original Salamah application. This project is designed to provide similar features and user experience, focusing on a permit requester registration form with dynamic field prefill, form validation, and submission using the Fetch API.

Features
Dynamic Field Prefill: Automatically fills form fields (e.g., Commercial Registration Number, Business Type, Email, Phone, etc.) when the user enters a company name that matches data from the API.

Form Validation: Ensures all required fields are filled out correctly before submission.

Form Submission: Submits form data to an API endpoint using the Fetch API, excluding sensitive fields like passwords.

Success and Error Handling: Displays success popups for successful submissions and error messages with animations for validation or API errors.

Terms & Conditions Popup: Provides a detailed Terms & Conditions popup for user agreement.

Loading Spinner: Shows a loading spinner during form submission to enhance user experience.
